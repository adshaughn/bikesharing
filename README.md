- Diving deeper, we next want to see when someone checks out a bike, how long they are using it for. Here, we can see the majority of users rent a bike for approximately 7 minutes.

![Checkout Lengths](/Images/overall_checkout)

- We can break it down further though to see that men have a slightly shorter trip duration of five minutes, versus women renting for six. This chart makes it clear though that the majority of users are male.

- Let's continue to try to understand usage patterns, here seeing that for both male and female subscribers, there are noticeably less users on Wednesdays.

- We can also look at which times of day are busiest, with weekdays showing peak useage in the mornings and evenings (during regular commuting hours), while weekend useage is more spread throughout the day (with subtle increases in the afternoons).
